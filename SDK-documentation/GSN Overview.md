## Life Cycle Management

The customer connection and hosting environment are easy-to-deploy and maintain through the following benefits:
* Automatic configuration and deployment through self-service portal
*	Standard protocols and Kongsberg templates are used based on commercially available HW 
*	Hardware management and continuous product development
*	Node management can include malware protection and intrusion detection
*	Marine approved HW (by DNV GL)
*	Kongsberg provides third line support on hardware and software solutions

## Remote Services

K-GSN is the basis for providing Remote Services, using remote access tools like BOMGAR. KONGSBERG Remote Services is a tool for certified Kongsberg engineers worldwide to connect to an installation upon customer request and provide support.
