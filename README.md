K-GSN is a key building block in KDI’s Digital Platform. It is segregated, encrypted and private using digital ID with certificate, node and user management, included two-factor user authentication. The network is integrated with cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure, making it more flexible, productive, faster and cost effective.

## Detailed description
The network is designed to interconnect KONGSBERG controlled support and data centres, and nodes owned by customers of KONGSBERG.

### Internet as carrier
Internet is the primary carrier between sites, due to cost issues with leased lines. Most of the sites will also be carried by a satellite link.

### Scalability
The network design is scalable up to 50 000 logical separated networks and more than 30 000 nodes within the KONGSBERG global IP addressing plan. In addition, close to 25 000 nodes with private IP addressing plan can be deployed within this design.

### Customer separation
All communication shall be carried by a common network infrastructure. The solution provides a reliable and secure separation of each customer communicating through the network.
